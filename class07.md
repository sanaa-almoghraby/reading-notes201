## Tables
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

## Define an HTML Table
The <table> tag defines an HTML table.

Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.

By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.

By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.

HTML Table - Cell that Spans Many Columns
To make a cell span more than one column, use the colspan attribute:

Example:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th colspan="2">Telephone</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bill Gates</td>
    <td>55577854</td>
    <td>55577855</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## CREATING MANY OBJECTS: CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION

Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.



STORING DATA
In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.
To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.
1. VAR IABLES
A variable has just one key (the variable name)
and one value.

* ex :var hotel= 'Quay' ;

2. ARRAYS
Arrays can store multiple pieces of information.
Each piece of information is separated by a comma.
The order of the values is important because items
in an array are assigned a number (called an index)
* ex:
var hotel s = [
' Quay ' ,
' Park' ,
' Beach' ,
'Bloomsbury'
]

## DATA TYPES REVISITED
1. String 
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Undefined (a variable that has been declared, but
no value has been assigned to it yet)
5. Null (a variable with no value - it may have had
one at some point, but no longer has a value)
6. 0bject
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
