Directory Structure
![](https://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/getting_started/v5/html/images/directory-structure.jpg)
* Relative URLs
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.
## Example
LINKS
This example is of a web page about film.
The <h1> element is used with an id attribute at the top of the page so
that a link can be added to take readers from the bottom of the page to
the top. There is an email link to allow readers to contact the author of
the web page. There are also a number of links to qualified URLs. These
link to various film festivals. Below this list is a link to a relative URL
which is an "about" page that lives in the same directory.

## Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

* Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
* Page Sizes
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
* Fixed Width Layouts
Fixed width layout
designs do not
change size as the
user increases
or decreases
the size of their
browser window.
Measurements tend
to be given in pixels.
* Liquid Layouts
Liquid layout designs
stretch and contract
as the user increases
or decreases the
size of their browser
window. They tend to
use percentages.
* CSS Frameworks
CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.
This chapter is divided into three sections that introduce:
* FU NCTIONS & METHODS
* OBJECTS
## WHAT IS A FUNCTI ON?
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than rep eating the same set of st atements).

GETTING MULTIPLE VALUES OUT OF A FUNCTION
6 Reasons for Pair Programming
 1. Greater efficiency
 2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
