## Forms
Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred
to a printed document that contains
spaces for you to fill in information.
* The <form> Element
The HTML <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

## How Forms Work
1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.
2. The name of each form
control is sent to the
server along with the
value the user enters or
selects
3. The server processes
the information using a
programming language
such as PHP, C#, VB.net,
or Java. It may also store
the information in a
database.
4. The server creates a new
page to send back to the
browser based on the
information received.
