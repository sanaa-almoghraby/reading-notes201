# Structure
--------------------------------------------------
** HTML Uses Elements
to Describe the
Structure of Pages**
Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

** Attributes Tell Us
More About Elements**

      Attribute
      Name
<p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English</p>

              Attribute
              Value

# Extra Markup

** DOCTYPEs**
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTMl the page is using (although browsers usually display the .page even if it is not included).
** Escape Characters **
There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.)

1.  Headers & Footers
<header> <footer>
The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:

* The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
* A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page.
2. Navigation
Article
<nav>
The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

# Process & Design
** WireFrames**
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.
