## WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

## Example:
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};
## JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:
* string
* number
* boolean
* null
* undefined

## Document Object Model
The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

## What is the HTML DOM?
The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

* The HTML elements as objects
* The properties of all HTML elements
* The methods to access all HTML elements
* The events for all HTML elements
In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

* The getElementById Method
The most common way to access an HTML element is to use the id of the element.

In the example above the getElementById method used id="demo" to find the element.

## Finding HTML Elements
Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements.

To do so, you have to find the elements first. There are several ways to do this:

* Finding HTML elements by id
* Finding HTML elements by tag name
* Finding HTML elements by class name
* Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
* Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections

## JavaScript HTML DOM - Changing CSS
To change the style of an HTML element, use this syntax:

document.getElementById(id).style.property = new style
